# my-frogs

This Python code creates a graphical simulation using Pygame, where frogs jump on a sequence of stones.
Each frog's jumping pattern is determined by its index: the first frog lands on every stone, the second frog on every second stone, the third frog on every third stone, and so on.
Each jump toggles the state of the stone (on/off).
The goal is to determine which stones will remain lit at the end of the simulation.

At the end of the animation, the stones that remain lit are those whose numbers are perfect squares.
